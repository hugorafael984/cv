  <br>
<p>I’m a 26 year old Portuguese and I’ve been speaking English on a daily basis for over 5 years now. I’m the type of employee who’s empathic, self-sufficient, creative, resilient, and good as a team member. My background is mostly in social sciences/studies and philosophy. As such, I’m interested in fields related to ethics, politics, law and overall morality. However, I have many other interests, such as languages, design, or marketing for example. </p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p><h4>September 2023</h4>
<h3>Freelance Interpreter at GDCC (Global Data Collection Company), Remote • </h3>
Working as a freelancer interpreter/interviewer, I’ve been learning how to get attention and workaround with people in order to get information for market researches. I’ve also sharpened my mind when it comes to better understand the basics of market researching and key questions, as, even though I’m not building up the surveys for such market researches, I’m conducting such things;

<h4>November 2021 – February 2023 </h4>
<h3>Customer service representative at Teleperformance Portugal, Lisbon • </h3>
Here I have worked my way from Junior customer support representative to Senior CSR and developed skills on platforms such as Zendesk, SRT, Workplace, amongst others. I have also contributed to the functioning of the project on ways such as floor support, minor IT inquiries, supervision and quality control. I also mastered how to engage in a respectful, fun and professional way, both with consumers and colleagues. Not only that, but I improved my communication skills and professionalism when it comes to dealing with customers. Therefore
 it has also had an impact on my ability to put myself on the consumer’s shoes and to see things both as a brand representative and as a customer, always putting the company interests first. Last but not least I’ve developed my problem-solving spirit as I had to fix problems on gaming devices mostly via troubleshooting, having to then work logistically when it had to come to a replacement ;

<h4>October 2020 – July 2021 </h4>
<h3>Volunteer internship as Assistant • </h3>
Here I’ve started my work experience on a hybrid position as I’d be either on site when required, and at my home office when no face to face contact was required. Since I was assisting the person in charge of the whole project, I’ve also commuted to construction sites in order to meet clients, assist with projects and overall facilitate contacts in between architects, engineers and clients. Apart from that, I was intermediating meetings with clients, taking care of paperwork, answering and taking care of emails, as well as putting budgets together. Thus, I upgraded my Microsoft office skills and learned to build budgets in an accounting platform called “TOCONLINE”, as well as in described word/pdf files;
